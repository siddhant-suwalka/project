# freeCodeCamp - Back End Development and APIs

This is my path on [this NodeJS certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/).

Please be aware that there is nothing here other than **spoilers**. After all, this is my solution to all the exercises
on this certification.

It took me two weeks on my free time to go through all the certification exercises.

Cheers.
